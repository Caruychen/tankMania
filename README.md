# Tank Mania!

A Simple 2D Top Down Tank game for 2 players. Made with C++ using the SFML Library, and a simple custom made collision engine.

Players compete for dominance in an all out tank battle! Either capture the opponent's flag, or destroy the opponent.

## How to Run

You will need to generate the binary for your system first before running the game.

1. Configure and build.
    Using CMake from the command line is straightforward as well.

    For a single-configuration generator (typically the case on Linux and macOS):
    ```
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build
    ```

    For a multi-configuration generator (typically the case on Windows):
    ```
    cmake -S . -B build
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```

    This should generate a binary file in `./build/bin/tankMania`
1. Enjoy!
